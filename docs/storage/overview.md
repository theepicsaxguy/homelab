# Storage Architecture Overview

## Storage Infrastructure

### Primary Storage (Longhorn)

- Version: 1.8.1
- High availability storage
- Replicated volumes
- Backup support
- Disaster recovery capabilities

### Backup Solution

- Restic with S3 backend
- Automated backup schedules
- Encryption at rest
- Point-in-time recovery

## Components

### Storage Classes

1. fast-storage

   - SSD-backed
   - High IOPS
   - Used for databases and high-performance workloads
   - Replicated across nodes

2. standard

   - General purpose storage
   - Balanced performance
   - Used for most applications
   - Standard replication

3. archive
   - Cold storage
   - Optimized for capacity
   - Used for backups and infrequently accessed data
   - Cost-effective storage

### Volume Management

- Dynamic provisioning
- Storage quotas
- Automated expansion
- Snapshot management

## Network Considerations

### Storage Network

- Dedicated storage network planned
- Currently shares main network
- VLAN isolation planned
- QoS controls planned

### Access Methods

- Block storage (primary)
- S3 compatible (backups)
- NFS integration (limited cases)
- iSCSI support (planned)

## High Availability

### Current Implementation

- Volume replication
- Node failure handling
- Automated recovery
- Data consistency checks

### Limitations

- Manual failover in some cases
- Basic monitoring only
- Limited performance metrics
- Manual capacity planning

## Performance Tuning

### Current Settings

- Default IO limits
- Basic QoS
- Standard replica count: 3
- Default chunk size

### Planned Optimizations

- IO prioritization
- Advanced QoS
- Performance monitoring
- Automated tuning

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- Daily application backups
- Hourly critical data backups
- Weekly full cluster backups
- Monthly archive backups

### Recovery Procedures

- Point-in-time recovery support
- Volume restoration
- Application data recovery
- Full cluster restoration

## Known Limitations

1. No automated performance monitoring
2. Manual backup verification required
3. Basic storage metrics only
4. Limited automated testing

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Tasks

- Backup verification
- Capacity monitoring
- Performance checks
- Storage cleanup

### Emergency Procedures

- Volume recovery
- Node failure handling
- Data corruption resolution
- Backup restoration

## Future Improvements

1. Storage monitoring implementation
2. Automated performance tuning
3. Advanced quota management
4. Enhanced backup verification
