# Network Security

## Overview

Network security is implemented through multiple layers using Cilium's eBPF-based security features and strict network
policies.

## Security Layers

### 1. Edge Security

```yaml
edge_security:
  cloudflare:
    - DDoS protection
    - WAF rules
    - Rate limiting
    - IP filtering
```

### 2. Cluster Security

- mTLS between services
- Network policy enforcement
- Protocol-aware filtering
- Microsegmentation

## Network Policies

### Default Policies

1. **Namespace Isolation**

   - Default deny all ingress
   - Explicit allow rules required
   - Cross-namespace restrictions
   - Service mesh integration

2. **Egress Control**
   - Default deny all egress
   - DNS resolution allowance
   - Explicit external access
   - HTTPS enforcement

## Service Mesh Security

1. **mTLS Configuration**

   - Certificate rotation
   - Identity verification
   - Traffic encryption
   - Key management

2. **Traffic Management**
   - Path-based routing
   - Load balancing
   - Circuit breaking
   - Retry policies

## Monitoring and Detection

1. **Network Flow Monitoring**

   - Hubble integration
   - Traffic analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Security events

2. **Incident Response**
   - Automated blocking
   - Policy enforcement
   - Traffic redirection
   - Forensics support
