# Kubelet Startup and Configuration Issues

## Date

## Category

- Kubernetes

## Status

In Progress

## Impact

- Worker nodes failing to join the cluster
- Kubelet service not starting properly
- Pod scheduling issues
- Node status reporting as NotReady

## Root Cause

1. Kubelet Configuration Synchronization:

   - Mismatched kubelet configuration between control plane and workers
   - Default configuration not properly propagated
   - Resource configuration misalignment

2. Node Registration Issues:

   - API server connectivity problems from worker nodes
   - Certificate authority trust issues
   - Node authorization failures

3. Resource Access:
   - Pod resources socket not properly mounted
   - Host paths permissions issues
   - System resource access limitations

## Detection

- Workers stuck in NotReady state
- Kubelet service logs showing startup failures
- Failed pod scheduling events
- Node registration timeouts

## Resolution

1. Kubelet Configuration:

   - Validate kubelet configuration synchronization
   - Ensure proper certificates distribution
   - Verify API server access from worker nodes

2. System Resources:

   - Check and correct host path mounts
   - Verify pod resources socket availability
   - Ensure proper permissions for system resources

3. Node Bootstrap:
   - Validate bootstrap token configuration
   - Check node authorization settings
   - Verify cluster join process

## Prevention

1. Configuration Management:

   - Implement kubelet configuration validation
   - Add configuration drift detection
   - Document required node configurations

2. Monitoring:

   - Add kubelet health monitoring
   - Implement node startup alerts
   - Track node registration metrics

3. Automation:
   - Create node validation scripts
   - Implement automatic configuration checks
   - Add node recovery procedures

## Related Issues

- DNS domain misconfiguration
- Node network connectivity problems
- API server access issues

## Notes

- Worker node health is critical for cluster operations
- Configuration must be consistent across all nodes
- Node bootstrap process needs proper validation steps
- Consider implementing automated node health checks
