# Storage Performance Configuration

## Overview

Storage performance is optimized through proper storage class selection, resource allocation, and monitoring.

## Storage Classes

### Performance Tiers

1. **Standard Storage**

   - General purpose workloads
   - Balanced performance
   - Cost-effective
   - Suitable for most applications

2. **High-Performance Storage**
   - Low-latency requirements
   - High IOPS workloads
   - Database storage
   - Real-time applications

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management

```yaml
storage_optimization:
  volume_placement:
    - Data locality
    - Node affinity
    - Resource distribution
    - Load balancing
  iops_management:
    - Quality of Service
    - Priority classes
    - Resource quotas
    - Bandwidth limits
```

### Workload Patterns

- Sequential vs Random IO
- Read/Write ratios
- Block size optimization
- Cache utilization

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- IOPS monitoring
- Latency tracking
- Throughput measurement
- Queue depth analysis

### Performance Alerts

- Latency thresholds
- IOPS degradation
- Resource exhaustion
- Queue depth alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Degradation**

   - Resource contention
   - Network bottlenecks
   - Storage saturation
   - Cache misuse

2. **Resolution Steps**
   - Performance analysis
   - Resource adjustment
   - Workload redistribution
   - Configuration optimization
