# Monitoring Strategy

## Current Monitoring

We currently rely on basic Kubernetes-native monitoring:

- Container health probes
- ArgoCD sync status
- Node conditions
- Service endpoints

This minimal approach has clear limitations in observability and incident response.

## Why We Need Better Monitoring

1. **Incident Detection**

   - Current: Manual checks and reactive response
   - Need: Early warning system and proactive alerts
   - Impact: Reduced downtime and faster recovery

2. **Performance Analysis**

   - Current: No historical metrics
   - Need: Trend analysis and capacity planning
   - Impact: Better resource allocation and scaling decisions

3. **Security Auditing**
   - Current: Basic API server audit logs
   - Need: Comprehensive security monitoring
   - Impact: Faster threat detection and response

## Immediate Focus (Q2 2025)

Rather than planning years ahead, we're focusing on essential monitoring:

### Core Metrics Stack

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Basic alerting for critical services

### Key Metrics

1. **Infrastructure Health**

   - Node resource usage
   - Storage capacity
   - Network performance

2. **Application Health**

   - Service availability
   - Response times
   - Error rates

3. **Security Metrics**
   - Authentication attempts
   - Policy violations
   - Certificate expiration

## Resource Planning

### Storage Requirements

- Metrics: 100GB initial allocation
- Logs: 200GB with retention policy
- Backups: Included in existing backup strategy

### Security Integration

- Authentication via existing Authelia
- RBAC following current policies
- Encrypted metrics storage

## Known Limitations

1. No log aggregation in initial phase
2. Basic alerting only
3. Manual dashboard setup
4. Limited historical data

These limitations are accepted for initial deployment to avoid overcomplicating the implementation.

## Success Criteria

1. All critical services monitored
2. Basic alerting functional
3. Key metrics collected
4. Resource usage tracked
