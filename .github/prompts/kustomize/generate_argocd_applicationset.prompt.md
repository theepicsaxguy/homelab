# Generate a Dynamic ApplicationSet for Kustomize-Based Apps

**Goal:** Create a configuration that dynamically generates applications based on Kustomize for multiple environments or
clusters.

**Instructions:**

- Define a template for dynamically creating applications using a generator approach.
- Ensure the template references the appropriate Kustomize overlays according to environment or cluster identifiers.
- Describe how to apply environment-specific configurations such as variables or resource limits.
- Provide guidance on verifying that the generated configuration complies with GitOps standards.
