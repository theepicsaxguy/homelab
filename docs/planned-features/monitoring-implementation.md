# Monitoring Implementation Plan

## Current Status: Not Implemented

This document tracks the planned implementation of the monitoring stack.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Metrics (Planned)
- Deploy Prometheus operator
- Configure basic service discovery
- Implement core infrastructure metrics
- Set up basic alerting

### Phase 2: Logging (Planned)
- Deploy Loki stack
- Configure log aggregation
- Implement structured logging
- Set up log retention policies

### Phase 3: Visualization (Planned)
- Deploy Grafana
- Configure core dashboards
- Set up user authentication
- Implement basic alerts

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Planned)
- Implement advanced alerting
- Configure SLO monitoring
- Set up custom metrics
- Deploy specialized dashboards

## Temporary Solutions

Until the monitoring stack is implemented, the following methods are used:

### Health Checking
- Built-in Kubernetes probes
- HTTP health endpoints
- ArgoCD application health

### Logging
- `kubectl logs` for application logs
- Kubernetes events for system state
- ArgoCD UI for sync status

### Metrics
- Basic Kubernetes metrics via kubectl
- Node resource usage via kubectl top
- Application-specific health endpoints

## Migration Path

1. Start with HTTP health checks (Current)
2. Implement Prometheus for metrics
3. Add Loki for logging
4. Deploy Grafana for visualization
5. Configure advanced alerting

## Dependencies

- Kubernetes metrics API
- Storage for time series data
- Network policies for monitoring
- RBAC configurations
