# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

I pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone. I commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for the
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by my mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for me as an individual, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
<https://github.com/theepicsaxguy/homelab/issues>.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
