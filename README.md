# Over-Engineered GitOps Homelab

[![CI](https://github.com/theepicsaxguy/homelab/actions/workflows/image-build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/theepicsaxguy/homelab/actions/workflows/image-build.yaml) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/theepicsaxguy/homelab)

After rebuilding my homelab one too many times, I committed to managing it entirely with GitOps. This repository is the result: a blueprint for a resilient, production-inspired Kubernetes cluster.

I'm sharing it to document my own journey and to help others build a stable, maintainable homelab without repeating my mistakes.

## The Stack

 This lab is built on a foundation of powerful, open-source tools that work together to create a fully automated system.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Proxmox access with your SSH key and install `opentofu`, `talosctl`, `kubectl`, and `argocd`. A little Kubernetes and Git know-how helps.
2. Clone this repository and follow the steps in the [Quick Start guide](https://homelab.orkestack.com/docs/getting-started).

## Why This Homelab?

- **Everything as Code:** I describe the entire lab in this repo. That gives me a full audit trail and lets me rebuild from scratch.
- **Automated from Day One:** Provisioning, deployments, and secrets run on autopilot.
- **Secure by Default:** Non-root containers, network policies, and single sign-on are baked in from the start.
- **Real-World Learning:** I'm applying enterprise ideas at home so I can tinker and pick up new skills.

## Who Is This For?

- **The Learner:** Understand how a production-grade Kubernetes stack really works.
- **The Tinkerer:** Deploy self-hosted apps on a stable base without endless upkeep.
- **The Pro:** Experiment with enterprise patterns or run a lab that "just works."

## Limitations

These docs describe how my cluster works today. Hardware or configuration changes
could make some steps outdated. Treat them as a reference to adapt rather than a
dropâ€‘in manual.
