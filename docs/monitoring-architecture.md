# Monitoring Architecture

## Overview

The monitoring stack is built around Prometheus and Grafana, providing comprehensive observability across the
infrastructure and application layers.

## Core Components

### Metrics Collection

```yaml
component:
  prometheus:
    purpose: 'Time-series metrics'
    features:
      - Service discovery
      - Alert management
      - PromQL queries
      - Long-term storage
```

### Visualization

```yaml
component:
  grafana:
    purpose: 'Metrics visualization'
    features:
      - Custom dashboards
      - Alert integration
      - Data source federation
      - Access control
```

## Monitoring Layers

### Infrastructure Monitoring

1. Node Metrics

   - CPU usage
   - Memory utilization
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic

2. Kubernetes Metrics
   - Control plane health
   - Node conditions
   - Resource utilization
   - Workload metrics

### Application Monitoring

```yaml
metrics:
  standard:
    - Request latency
    - Error rates
    - Throughput
    - Saturation
  custom:
    - Business metrics
    - User experience
    - Application health
```

## Alert Management

### Alert Rules

```yaml
alert_categories:
  infrastructure:
    - Node health
    - Resource exhaustion
    - Network issues
  applications:
    - Service health
    - Performance degradation
    - Error thresholds
```

### Alert Routing

1. Severity Levels

   - Critical: Immediate action
   - Warning: Investigation needed
   - Info: Awareness only

2. Notification Channels
   - Email notifications
   - Chat integrations
   - On-call rotation

## Performance Monitoring

### Resource Metrics

```yaml
thresholds:
  cpu:
    warning: '80%'
    critical: '90%'
  memory:
    warning: '85%'
    critical: '95%'
  disk:
    warning: '80%'
    critical: '90%'
```

### Network Monitoring

1. Hubble Integration

   - Flow monitoring
   - Latency tracking
   - Policy validation

2. Service Metrics
   - Request rates
   - Error percentages
   - Latency percentiles

## Log Management

### Log Collection

```yaml
log_sources:
  system:
    - Kernel logs
    - Service logs
    - Security events
  applications:
    - Container logs
    - Application logs
    - Access logs
```

### Log Processing

1. Aggregation

   - Centralized collection
   - Parsing and indexing
   - Retention policies

2. Analysis
   - Pattern detection
   - Anomaly detection
   - Correlation

## Dashboard Organization

### Standard Dashboards

```yaml
dashboards:
  cluster_overview:
    - Resource utilization
    - Node status
    - Workload health
  application_metrics:
    - Service status
    - Performance metrics
    - Error rates
```

### Custom Views

1. Team Dashboards

   - Role-specific metrics
   - SLO tracking
   - Custom alerts

2. Business Metrics
   - User metrics
   - System usage
   - Performance KPIs

## Storage and Retention

### Metrics Retention

```yaml
retention_policies:
  raw_metrics: '15 days'
  aggregated: '90 days'
  alerts: '180 days'
  logs: '30 days'
```

### Storage Configuration

1. Local Storage

   - High-performance storage
   - Regular backups
   - Compression

2. Long-term Storage
   - Historical data
   - Compliance records
   - Performance analysis

## Integration Points

### External Systems

```yaml
integrations:
  alerting:
    - Email
    - Chat platforms
    - Incident management
  visualization:
    - External Grafana
    - Custom dashboards
    - API access
```

### Authentication

1. Access Control

   - RBAC integration
   - SSO support
   - API tokens

2. Audit Trail
   - User actions
   - Configuration changes
   - Alert management

## Performance Impact

### Resource Usage

```yaml
monitoring_footprint:
  prometheus:
    cpu: '2 cores'
    memory: '8GB'
  grafana:
    cpu: '1 core'
    memory: '2GB'
```

### Optimization

1. Scrape Intervals

   - Default: 30s
   - Critical: 15s
   - Long-term: 5m

2. Data Retention
   - Hot storage
   - Cold storage
   - Archive storage

## Future Enhancements

1. Monitoring Capabilities

   - Enhanced tracing
   - ML-based anomaly detection
   - Automated remediation

2. Integration Improvements

   - Additional data sources
   - Advanced correlations
   - Custom exporters

3. Visualization Updates
   - New dashboard templates
   - Enhanced reporting
   - Real-time analytics
