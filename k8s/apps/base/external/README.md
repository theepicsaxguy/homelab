# External Service Integrations

Because sometimes we need to play nice with the outside world! 🌍

## Integrated Services

### Home Automation

```yaml
homeassistant:
  type: 'External VM'
  integration: 'API access'
  features:
    - Custom component support
    - Webhook integration
    - Metrics export
```

### Proxmox Integration

- CSI driver connectivity
- VM management
- Resource monitoring
- Backup coordination

### TrueNAS Storage

- NFS/iSCSI backends
- Snapshot management
- Backup targets
- Performance metrics

## Network Architecture

### Access Methods

- Internal service mesh
- Dedicated VLANs
- Secure tunneling
- Rate-limited APIs

### Security Zones

```yaml
zones:
  external:
    access: 'Restricted'
    encryption: 'Required'
    monitoring: 'Enhanced'
  storage:
    access: 'Dedicated network'
    encryption: 'In-transit'
    monitoring: 'Performance focused'
```

## Performance Considerations

| Service        | Network   | Storage | Notes                |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Home Assistant | VLAN      | Local   | Low latency required |
| Proxmox        | Dedicated | N/A     | Management traffic   |
| TrueNAS        | 10GbE     | N/A     | Storage backbone     |

## Monitoring Integration

### Metrics Collection

- Service health
- API response times
- Storage performance
- Network latency

### Alerting Rules

```yaml
alerts:
  api_latency: '>500ms'
  storage_latency: '>10ms'
  availability: '<99.9%'
```

## Known Challenges

1. API Rate Limits

   - Solution: Caching layer
   - Status: Implemented

2. Storage Latency
   - Solution: Connection pooling
   - Status: Optimized

## Recovery Procedures

### Service Disruption

1. Check connectivity
2. Verify API tokens
3. Validate network paths
4. Review rate limits

### Storage Issues

1. Verify network path
2. Check mount points
3. Validate permissions
4. Monitor IO stats

## Future Plans

- [ ] Enhanced caching
- [ ] Automated failover
- [ ] Better metrics
- [ ] API versioning

Remember: External services are like in-laws - treat them with respect, but keep them at a safe distance! 🎯
