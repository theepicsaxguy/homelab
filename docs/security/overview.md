# Security Architecture

## Core Security Decisions

### Zero-Trust Model

**Decision:** Implement zero-trust security from infrastructure up

**Rationale:**

- Traditional perimeter security insufficient for modern threats
- Dynamic microservice environments need identity-based security
- GitOps requires strict change control
- Containers demand fine-grained access control

**Trade-offs:**

- Higher initial complexity
- More configuration overhead
- Steeper learning curve

### Authentication Strategy

**Decision:** Authelia as central authentication provider

**Rationale:**

- Native Kubernetes integration
- Lower resource usage than alternatives
- Simple SSO implementation
- OIDC support for automation

**Trade-offs:**

- Less mature than Keycloak
- Fewer enterprise features
- Smaller community

### Directory Service

**Decision:** LLDAP for user management

**Rationale:**

- Lightweight implementation
- Simple management interface
- Sufficient feature set
- Easy backup/restore

**Trade-offs:**

- Limited advanced features
- Basic schema support
- No multi-master replication

### Secret Management

**Decision:** Bitwarden Secrets Manager with operator

**Rationale:**

- Native Kubernetes integration
- Simple secret rotation
- Automated sync support
- Clear audit trail

**Trade-offs:**

- Additional system dependency
- Sync latency considerations
- Premium features cost

## Current Status

### Implemented

- Zero-trust network model
- Central authentication
- Basic RBAC policies
- Secret management

### Known Gaps

1. Limited audit logging
2. Basic policy verification
3. Simple security scanning
4. Manual secret rotation

## Next Steps

Priority improvements:

1. Enhanced audit system
2. Automated policy testing
3. Security scanning pipeline
4. Automated secret rotation
