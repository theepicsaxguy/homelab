## üìå Why This Homelab?

I was fed up with manually fixing and maintaining multiple VMs and their operating systems. With a baby on the way, I
needed a foolproof, low-maintenance system. This homelab is my answer:

- **Automation Overhead?** Gone.
- **Manual Fixes at 3 AM?** Not happening.
- **Downtime?** Reduced to a minimum.

It's designed to be robust and self-recovering‚Äîso I can focus on my family rather than fighting infrastructure
meltdowns.

## üñ• Infrastructure & Applications Overview

### Core Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is built on a GitOps foundation that makes everything reproducible and auditable.

**Key Components:**

- **Talos Linux:** A Kubernetes-native OS that minimizes attack surface and maintenance.
- **ArgoCD:** Our GitOps engine that ensures the cluster state always matches Git.
- **Cilium:** Provides fast, secure networking with eBPF and native Gateway API support.
- **Longhorn & Proxmox CSI:** Distributed storage solutions for resilience and scalability.
- **Authelia & LDAP:** For centralized authentication and secure access control.

_\*\*For more details, check out our [Architecture Deep Dive](docs/architecture.md)._

### Environment Strategy

We run one Kubernetes cluster and use robust namespace isolation to separate:

- **Development:** Fast, minimal resources for rapid iteration.
- **Staging:** A production-like environment for realistic testing.
- **Production:** Fully high-availability with strict security controls.

This approach optimizes resource use without sacrificing isolation or reliability.

### Technology Stack

- **Talos Linux**
- **ArgoCD**
- **Cilium**
- **Kustomize**
- **Bitwarden** (Secrets Management)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

If you‚Äôre ready to deploy your foolproof homelab, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theepicsaxguy/homelab.git
   cd homelab
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have [Tofu](https://opentofu.org) installed along with any other
   prerequisites.

3. **Deploy the Infrastructure:**

   ```bash
   cd tofu/kubernetes
   tofu init && tofu apply
   ```

4. **Deploy Kubernetes Workloads via ArgoCD:**

   ```bash
   cd ../../k8s
   tofu init && tofu apply
   ```

5. **Verify & Enjoy:** Check your deployment status and celebrate as your homelab comes to life‚Äîready to self-heal and
   keep you out of midnight fix sessions.

## üõ† Operational Excellence

### Disaster Recovery: The 4-Command Rule

When disaster strikes (like an unexpected VM meltdown‚Äîor a diaper blowout), your homelab is designed to resurrect in
minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theepicsaxguy/homelab.git
cd tofu/kubernetes

# 2. Deploy the infrastructure
tofu init && tofu apply

# 3. Deploy workloads via ArgoCD
cd ../../k8s
tofu init && tofu apply
```

> **Note:** Back online faster than you can say, ‚ÄúI need more sleep!‚Äù üòÖ

## ü§î Final Thoughts

This isn‚Äôt just a homelab‚Äîit‚Äôs my escape from endless VM fixes and the chaos of life, engineered to be self-healing so I
can enjoy family time. It‚Äôs built for:

- **Automation:** So you (and I) can sleep in on weekends.
- **Rapid Recovery:** Because a few commands should bring everything back online.
- **Zero Headaches:** Let the system work its magic while you focus on what matters.

When things break, they get fixed. When chaos ensues, a quick command restores order. And that, my friends, is how you
free up time for family, love, and a bit of coding adrenaline.
