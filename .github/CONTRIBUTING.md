# How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome and appreciated. This project thrives on community input. To keep things running smoothly, please follow these guidelines.

## Philosophy

- **GitOps is Law:** All changes to the cluster must be made through Git. No manual `kubectl apply` for permanent changes.
- **Automate Everything:** If it can be scripted or managed by a controller, it should be.
- **Security is Not an Afterthought:** I use non-root containers, network policies, and externalized secrets by default.
