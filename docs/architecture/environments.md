# Environment Strategy

## Core Strategy Decisions

### Environment Model

**Decision:** Three-tier environment model (Development → Staging → Production)

**Rationale:**

- Balances testing thoroughness with operational overhead
- Provides clear promotion path for changes
- Allows proper validation without excessive complexity
- Maintains consistent infrastructure across all tiers

**Trade-offs:**

- More resource overhead than dev/prod only
- Additional complexity in promotion process
- Higher maintenance burden

### Resource Allocation

**Decision:** Progressive resource limits across environments

**Rationale:**

- Development: Minimal resources for fast iteration
- Staging: Production-like for accurate testing
- Production: Full HA with guaranteed resources

**Trade-offs:**

- Higher total resource requirements
- More complex resource management
- Potential for environment-specific bugs

### Security Boundaries

**Decision:** Namespace-based isolation with strict network policies

**Rationale:**

- Network isolation between environments
- Role-based access control per namespace
- Resource quotas for fair sharing
- Independent secret management

**Trade-offs:**

- More complex policy management
- Higher operational overhead
- Increased setup complexity

## Implementation Status

### Current Capabilities

- Namespace isolation
- Basic RBAC policies
- Resource quotas
- Network segregation

### Known Gaps

1. Manual promotion process
2. Basic validation gates
3. Limited automation
4. Simple rollback process

## Next Steps

Priority improvements needed:

1. Automated promotion workflow
2. Enhanced validation gates
3. Comprehensive testing
4. Rollback automation
