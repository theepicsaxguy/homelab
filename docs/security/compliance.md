### 2. Network Controls

- Zero-trust network model
- Encrypted communication
- Network segmentation
- Traffic monitoring

### 3. Data Protection

- Database encryption at rest
- Storage volume encryption
- Backup encryption
- Secure data deletion

## Monitoring Requirements

### 1. Audit Logging

- API server audit logs
- Authentication attempts
- Authorization decisions
- Configuration changes

### 2. Security Events

- Network policy violations
- Authentication failures
- Privilege escalation
- Resource access
