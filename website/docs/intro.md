title: Homelab Kubernetes Configuration Guide
---

# Overview

This guide explains our homelab Kubernetes setup, designed to help IT admins understand, run, and maintain the system.

# Core Design Principles

1. **GitOps as Source of Truth**
   - All cluster states live in this Git repo
   - ArgoCD syncs cluster state with Git definitions
   - Changes require Git commits for audit tracking

2. **Declarative Configuration**
   - Uses Kubernetes YAML, Kustomize, and Terraform
   - Tools manage state based on defined specs

3. **Automated Operations**
   - ArgoCD ApplicationSets handle deployments
   - Cert-Manager runs certificate lifecycle
   - CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment

4. **Security First**
   - Non-root container execution
   - Network policies control traffic
   - External secrets management
   - Regular security scans

5. **Clean Organization**
   - Kustomize manages configurations
   - ArgoCD projects group related apps
   - ApplicationSets simplify scaling
