# Application Architecture

## Core Application Decisions

### Deployment Strategy

**Decision:** Use ApplicationSets for all deployments

**Rationale:**

- Single source of truth for app definitions
- Automated synchronization across environments
- Simplified promotion path
- Consistent configuration management

**Trade-offs:**

- More complex initial setup
- Additional abstraction layer
- Steeper learning curve

### Resource Management

**Decision:** Progressive resource allocation model

**Rationale:**

- Development: Minimal resources for rapid iteration
- Staging: Representative of production
- Production: Full HA with guaranteed resources

**Trade-offs:**

- Higher total resource usage
- More complex capacity planning
- Potential environment differences

### High Availability Model

**Decision:** Environment-specific HA requirements

**Rationale:**

- Development: Single replica for speed
- Staging: Basic HA for testing
- Production: Full HA with anti-affinity

**Trade-offs:**

- Resource overhead in higher environments
- More complex deployment patterns
- Additional failure scenarios to test

### Security Implementation

**Decision:** Zero-trust with centralized authentication

**Rationale:**

- Single sign-on across all applications
- Consistent authentication flow
- Centralized access control
- Unified audit logging

**Trade-offs:**

- Additional system dependency
- More complex initial setup
- Higher operational overhead

## Current Status

### Implemented

- ApplicationSet-based deployments
- Basic environment promotion
- Resource limit enforcement
- Authentication integration

### Known Gaps

1. Manual promotion process
2. Basic validation gates
3. Limited automated testing
4. Simple monitoring

## Next Steps

Priority improvements:

1. Automated promotion workflow
2. Enhanced validation testing
3. Comprehensive monitoring
4. Advanced security controls
