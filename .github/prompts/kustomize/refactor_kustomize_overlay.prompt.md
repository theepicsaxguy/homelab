- Propose a method to extract common configurations into a reusable base.
- Outline steps to verify the refactored overlayâ€™s integrity using standard build and diff techniques.
- Include guidelines for updating associated documentation to reflect the new structure, ensuring adherence to GitOps
  principles.
