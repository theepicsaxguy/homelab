title: CI/CD and repository maintenance
---

This document outlines the use of GitHub features, specifically GitHub Actions and Dependabot, to maintain this homelab
repository, ensure code quality, and automate the release process.

## About CI/CD and dependency management

Automated workflows and proactive dependency management are crucial for maintaining a healthy, secure, and up-to-date
codebase, even for a personal homelab project. These practices help catch errors early, reduce manual effort, and
improve overall stability.

### GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

#### Release Please workflow

- **File:** `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
- **Function:** This workflow employs the `googleapis/release-please-action` to automate the process of semantic
  versioning and release creation based on Conventional Commit messages merged into the `main` branch.
- **How it works:**
  1. When commits adhering to the Conventional Commits specification are pushed to the `main` branch, `release-please`
     analyzes these messages.
  2. If it identifies commits that signify a new version (e.g., `feat:` for a minor release, `fix:` for a patch release,
     or a commit message containing `BREAKING CHANGE:` for a major release), it automatically creates or updates a
     "release pull request." This PR includes an updated `CHANGELOG.md` file (generated from the commit messages) and
     proposes a version bump (typically managed via Git tags, which Release Please will also create).
  3. When this release PR is reviewed and merged into `main`, the `release-please-action` then proceeds to create a
     corresponding GitHub Release. This release is tagged with the new version number and includes the generated
     changelog entries.
- **Permissions:** The workflow requires `contents: write` permission to push tags and update the changelog file in the
  repository. It also needs `pull-requests: write` permission to create and update the release pull request.
- **`release-type: simple`:** A straightforward versioning scheme is used, suitable for projects that don't require
  complex monorepo or multi-package release strategies. :::info **Rationale for Release Please:**
  - **Automated Versioning & Changelogs:** This significantly reduces the manual effort involved in version bumping and
    drafting changelog notes.
  - **Conventional Commits:** It encourages the use of a structured commit history, which improves the clarity and
    traceability of changes.
  - **Release Pull Requests:** The release PR provides a clear point for reviewing the upcoming release, its version
    increment, and its changelog before it is finalized and tagged. :::

#### Implied validation workflows

While not explicitly detailed as a YAML file in the provided context, the presence of various validation scripts within
the repository (e.g., `validate_argocd.sh`, `validate_charts.sh`, `validate_manifests.sh`, and the pre-commit hook
script `hooks/validate-external-secrets.sh`) strongly suggests the existence of GitHub Actions workflows that execute
these scripts.

- **Purpose:** These Continuous Integration (CI) workflows would be configured to automatically lint and validate
  Kubernetes configurations, Helm charts, and other scripts. The primary goal is to detect errors early in the
  development cycle and maintain overall code quality.
- **Typical Triggers:** Such CI workflows are commonly triggered:
  - On every push to the `main` branch.
  - On every push to a branch that is part of a pull request targeting `main`.
- **Typical Jobs:** A CI workflow for this repository would likely include jobs for:
  - Linting YAML files and shell scripts.
  - Executing `validate_argocd.sh`, which encompasses Kustomize builds, `kubeconform` schema validation, ArgoCD health
    checks, and diffs.
  - Running `validate_charts.sh` for Helm chart linting.
  - Executing specific hook scripts like `validate-external-secrets.sh` if applicable at the CI level. :::info
    **Rationale for CI validation workflows:** Automated checks performed during CI are essential for preventing flawed
    or broken configurations from being merged into the main development line and potentially deployed. They act as a
    critical quality gate. :::

### Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

- **File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Function:** This file configures Dependabot to automatically check for updates to various types of dependencies used
  across the repository. When updates are found, Dependabot can be configured to create pull requests to apply them.
- **Configuration Details:**
  - `version: 2`: Specifies the Dependabot configuration schema version.
  - `enable-beta-ecosystems: true`: This option is enabled, likely to support newer package ecosystems or features, such
    as improved Helm chart dependency updates.
  - **Package Ecosystems Monitored:**
    - `npm`: Checks for updates to Node.js packages (if a `package.json` file is present at the root).
    - `terraform`: Scans the entire repository for Terraform provider and module dependencies defined in `.tf` files.
    - `docker`: Scans the `/k8s/` directory for Docker image references (e.g., in Kubernetes manifests or potentially
      Dockerfiles if present) and suggests updates to newer image tags or digests.
    - `github-actions`: Monitors GitHub Actions used in the repository's workflows (typically in `.github/workflows/`)
      for available updates.
    - `helm`: Scans the root directory (and recursively by default) for Helm chart dependencies (e.g., defined in
      `Chart.yaml` files or potentially referenced in ArgoCD Application sources if they are configured to track
      specific chart versions from repositories).
  - **Schedule:** All monitored ecosystems are configured for `daily` update checks.
  - **Registries (Commented Out):** The configuration includes commented-out examples for setting up access to private
    registries (e.g., GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), Google Cloud Artifact Registry, AWS Elastic Container Registry
    (ECR)). If private Docker images or Helm charts were sourced from these locations, these sections would need to be
    uncommented and configured with appropriate credentials (typically managed via GitHub secrets). :::info **Rationale
    for private registry configuration:** This allows Dependabot to access and propose updates for dependencies that are
    hosted in private, authenticated sources, which would otherwise be inaccessible. ::: :::info **Rationale for
    Dependabot:**
  - **Security:** Helps keep dependencies current, which is crucial as updates often include fixes for security
    vulnerabilities.
  - **Stability and Feature Access:** Ensures the use of the latest stable versions of software tools, libraries, and
    components, providing access to new features and bug fixes.
  - **Efficiency:** Automates the otherwise tedious and error-prone task of manually checking for and applying
    dependency updates across multiple ecosystems. :::

### Pre-commit hooks (`.github/hooks/`)

- **File:** `.github/hooks/validate-external-secrets.sh`
  - **Function:** This script is designed to validate `ExternalSecret` Kubernetes manifests. It specifically checks for
    the presence of required fields and ensures that `refreshInterval` values are set to sensible durations.
  - **Likely Usage:** This script would typically be integrated into a pre-commit hook framework (such as the one
    provided by `pre-commit.com`). When a developer attempts to commit changes, this hook would automatically run on the
    staged files. If any validation issues are found by the script, the commit process would be aborted, prompting the
    developer to fix the errors before the commit can proceed. :::info **Rationale for pre-commit hooks:** Pre-commit
    hooks provide immediate feedback to the developer directly within their local development environment. They help
    catch common errors and enforce project standards _before_ code is pushed to the remote repository or processed by
    CI systems. This saves developer time, reduces the load on CI resources, and helps maintain a cleaner commit
    history. :::

By combining GitHub Actions for continuous integration, Dependabot for automated dependency management, and pre-commit
hooks for local validation, this setup aims to maintain a high-quality, secure, and up-to-date codebase for the homelab
infrastructure.
