# Development Environments

Where the magic happens - automated dev environments because local development is so last decade! ðŸ§ª

## Components

### IDE Environments

- Code Server (VS Code in browser)
- JupyterHub for notebooks
- Terminal environments

### Development Tools

```yaml
tools:
  languages:
    - Python
    - Node.js
    - Go
    - Rust
  debugging:
    - Remote debugging
    - Hot reload
    - Live preview
```

## Resource Management

### Default Quotas

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: '2'
    memory: '4Gi'
    storage: '10Gi'
  requests:
    cpu: '500m'
    memory: '1Gi'
```

### Storage Classes

- fast-storage: For source code
- shared-storage: For build caches
- tmp-storage: For ephemeral data

## Network Configuration

- Isolated dev networks
- Service mesh integration
- Ingress through Gateway API
- Development URLs pattern: `{project}.dev.local`

## Security Features

1. Environment Isolation

   - Namespace per project
   - Network policies
   - Resource quotas

2. Access Control
   - IDE authentication
   - Git integration
   - Secrets management

## Performance Optimizations

- Shared build cache
- Pre-pulled images
- Resource limits
- Node anti-affinity

## Development Workflow

1. Create Environment:

   ```bash
   # Via GitOps, of course!
   git push -u origin feature/new-dev-env
   ```

2. Access IDE:

   - Browser: https://ide.dev.local
   - VSCode Remote: devspaces://connect

3. Start Coding:
   - Auto-save
   - Live reload
   - Instant preview

## Monitoring

- Resource usage
- Build times
- Cache hit rates
- Network latency

## Known Issues

1. Initial cold start

   - Solution: Workspace prewarming
   - Status: In progress

2. Cache cleanup
   - Solution: Automated GC
   - Status: Implemented

## Future Plans

- [ ] More language support
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Cross-env collaboration
- [ ] AI code assistance

Remember: The best dev environment is the one you don't have to maintain locally! ðŸ’»
