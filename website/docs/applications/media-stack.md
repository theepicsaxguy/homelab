- **Features**:
  - Hardware-accelerated transcoding (Intel QuickSync)
  - Direct play optimization
  - Multi-user support
  - HDR tone mapping

### Management Suite (*arr Stack)

#### Sonarr
- **Purpose**: TV series management and automation
- **Key Features**:
  - Series monitoring
  - Release quality profiles
  - Automated download management

#### Radarr
- **Purpose**: Movie collection management
- **Key Features**:
  - Movie monitoring
  - Quality profiles
  - Custom formats support

#### Prowlarr
- **Purpose**: Unified indexer management
- **Features**:
  - Centralized indexer configuration
  - Integration with *arr applications
  - Stats and history tracking

## Infrastructure Configuration

### Storage Layout

```yaml
Storage Classes:
  media-storage:        # For media files
    type: Longhorn
    replication: 1
    size: 2Ti
  metadata-storage:     # For application data
    type: Longhorn
    replication: 2
    size: 100Gi
```

### Resource Allocation

| Application | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Memory Request | Memory Limit | Storage     |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Jellyfin   | 2           | 4         | 2Gi           | 4Gi         | 2Ti (media) |
| Sonarr     | 500m        | 1         | 512Mi         | 1Gi         | 10Gi        |
| Radarr     | 500m        | 1         | 512Mi         | 1Gi         | 10Gi        |
| Prowlarr   | 250m        | 500m      | 256Mi         | 512Mi       | 5Gi         |

### Network Configuration

- **Internal Access**: Via Cilium ClusterIP services
- **External Access**: Through Cilium Gateway API
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Authentik SSO
- **Security**: Zero-trust model with explicit policy

## Performance Optimizations

### Jellyfin Optimizations

1. **Hardware Acceleration**
   ```yaml
   devices:
     - /dev/dri/renderD128  # Intel QuickSync device
   ```

2. **Storage Performance**
   - Direct volume mounts for media
   - SSD storage class for metadata
   - Optimized read patterns

### *arr Stack Optimizations

1. **Database Performance**
   - SQLite on SSD storage
   - Regular VACUUM scheduling
   - Proper journal modes

2. **Network Performance**
   - Keep-alive connections
   - Efficient API polling
   - Scheduled tasks distribution

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics

- Transcode queue length
- Storage utilization
- Network throughput
- API response times

### Alerts Configuration

```yaml
alerts:
  storage:
    threshold: 85%
    warning: 75%
  transcoding:
    queue_length: >10
    duration: >30m
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

1. **Library Scan Impact**
   - **Issue**: High CPU usage during scans
   - **Solution**: Implemented scheduled scans during off-peak hours
   - **Status**: Managed via CronJob

2. **Database Performance**
   - **Issue**: SQLite contention under load
   - **Solution**: Moved to SSD storage, optimized vacuum schedule
   - **Status**: Monitoring via Prometheus

## Roadmap

- [ ] Integration with Home Assistant for automation
- [ ] Implementation of cross-node GPU sharing
- [ ] Enhanced metadata caching layer
- [ ] Backup strategy improvements

## Troubleshooting Guide

1. **Transcoding Issues**
   - Verify GPU access permissions
   - Check transcode temporary directory
   - Monitor GPU utilization

2. **Download Issues**
   - Validate indexer connectivity
   - Check download client settings
   - Verify storage permissions

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Review resource utilization
   - Check network connectivity
   - Validate storage performance
