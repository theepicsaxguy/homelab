Welcome! This blog follows my journey building a modern, Kubernetes-based homelab. I’ll share lessons, challenges, and discoveries as I create and manage an open-source, enterprise-inspired platform at home.

Are you curious if this journey is for you? Use the checklist below:


## Why This Homelab?

This project is about learning and building a robust, automated lab environment at home. Here are the principles and tools at its core:

- **Kubernetes as the Core:** Using [Talos OS](https://www.talos.dev/) for a minimal, API-driven Kubernetes setup.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) manages virtual machines on Proxmox.
- **GitOps First:** [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) handles all cluster changes using Git as the source of truth.
- **Declarative Configuration:** [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) makes complex Kubernetes manifests easier to manage.
- **Full Automation:** CI/CD with GitHub Actions, automatic SSL with Cert-Manager, and more.

**Goal:** A system that’s reliable, easy to audit, and fun to operate.

## What You'll Find on This Blog

This space documents each stage of the homelab build.

You'll see:
- **Deep Dives:** In-depth reviews of tech like Cilium networking, Longhorn storage, or Authentik for authentication.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** Guides for new services or solving tricky problems.
- **Troubleshooting & Learnings:** What broke, and how I fixed it.
- **New Features:** Fresh apps and major upgrades as they happen.
- **Milestones:** Project status, refactors, and documentation highlights.
