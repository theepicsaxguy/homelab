# Storage Architecture Overview

## Storage Infrastructure

The cluster uses a distributed block storage architecture built on Longhorn for high availability and reliability.

## Components

### 1. Storage Provider

- **Longhorn Distributed Storage**
  - Dynamic volume provisioning
  - Storage replication (3 replicas)
  - Backup and recovery support
  - Volume snapshots
  - Live volume expansion

### 2. Storage Classes

```yaml
storage_classes:
  longhorn:
    type: 'distributed block storage'
    provisioner: 'driver.longhorn.io'
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
    parameters:
      numberOfReplicas: '3'
      staleReplicaTimeout: '30'
      fsType: 'ext4'
```

### 3. Backup and Recovery

- Volume snapshots
- Automated backup scheduling
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Data locality options

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Storage overprovisioning (200%)
- Replica auto-balancing
- Resource limits
  - CPU: 500m
  - Memory: 512Mi

## Network Considerations

- Direct container storage access
- Internal cluster traffic
- Backup network segregation
- iSCSI communication

## Monitoring Integration

- Volume health monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Replica status
- Backup verification
