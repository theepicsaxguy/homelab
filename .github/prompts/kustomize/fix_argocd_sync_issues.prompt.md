# Detect and Fix Sync Issues with Kustomize

**Goal:** Analyze a GitOps environment to identify and fix synchronization issues related to Kustomize configurations.

**Instructions:**

- Identify applications that are not in sync, focusing on potential issues like missing overlays, namespace mismatches,
  outdated patches, or resource conflicts.
- Determine the underlying cause of the sync issues.
- Outline a strategy to generate and apply a patch or configuration update that addresses the problem without making
  direct changes to the source manifests unless necessary.
- Describe how to validate that the issue is resolved after applying the fix.
