# Monitoring Architecture

> **Note**: This document describes the planned monitoring architecture. The monitoring stack is not currently
> implemented.

The monitoring stack will be implemented with the following components when deployed:

## Planned Components

1. **Metrics Collection**

   - Prometheus for metric collection and storage
   - ServiceMonitors for automatic service discovery
   - Custom PodMonitors for specific workload monitoring

2. **Logging Infrastructure**

   - Loki for log aggregation and querying
   - Promtail for log collection from containers
   - Structured logging support

3. **Visualization**

   - Grafana for dashboards and alerts
   - Built-in templates for common use cases
   - Custom dashboards for specific workloads

4. **Alerting**
   - AlertManager for alert routing and management
   - Integration with communication platforms
   - Escalation policies and silence periods

## Current State

At present, the cluster relies on:

- Built-in Kubernetes health checks
- Basic HTTP endpoint monitoring
- ArgoCD application health status

For monitoring needs, refer to:

- Application logs via `kubectl logs`
- ArgoCD UI for sync and health status
- Built-in Kubernetes events

## Implementation Plan

The monitoring stack will be implemented as part of the infrastructure ApplicationSet in the future. Track progress and
planning in the repository issues.
