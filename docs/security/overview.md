# Security Architecture

## Overview

Our security architecture follows a zero-trust model with defense in depth, implemented through multiple layers of
security controls.

## Core Components

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Authentication (Authelia)

- SSO provider for all applications
- OIDC integration
- MFA support
- User directory integration with LLDAP

#### Authorization

- Kubernetes RBAC
- Namespace isolation
- Service account management
- Policy enforcement via Gatekeeper

### Secret Management

#### Bitwarden Secrets Manager

- Central secrets store
- Automated secret injection
- Rotation capabilities
- Access auditing

### Network Security

#### Zero Trust Implementation

- Cilium network policies
- Service mesh mTLS
- Ingress/egress control
- Traffic encryption

#### Gateway Security

- TLS termination
- Certificate management
- Rate limiting (planned)
- WAF capabilities (planned)

### Infrastructure Security

#### Base Security

- Talos Linux hardening
- Immutable infrastructure
- Automated updates
- Security scanning (planned)

#### Container Security

- Non-root containers
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped capabilities
- Resource limitations

## Current Security Controls

### Implemented

1. Authentication via Authelia
2. RBAC for all components
3. Network policies
4. Secret management
5. TLS everywhere
6. Container hardening
7. Infrastructure immutability

### Planned

1. Security monitoring
2. Automated compliance checks
3. Advanced threat detection
4. Security metrics collection

## Environment-Specific Security

### Development

- Relaxed network policies
- Debug capabilities enabled
- Full logging
- Test credentials allowed

### Staging

- Production-like security
- Limited debug access
- Sanitized data
- Test security controls

### Production

- Strict security enforcement
- No direct debug access
- Production data protection
- Regular security audits

## Access Control

### External Access

- Gateway API controls
- Authentication required
- TLS termination
- IP filtering

### Internal Access

- Service mesh control
- Namespace isolation
- RBAC enforcement
- Pod security standards

## Certificate Management

### Implementation

- cert-manager
- ACME/Let's Encrypt
- Automated renewal
- Wildcard certificates

### Distribution

- Secret injection
- TLS termination
- Service mesh certificates
- Application certificates

## Known Limitations

1. No automated security scanning
2. Manual policy verification
3. Basic audit logging only
4. Limited compliance automation

## Future Enhancements

1. Security monitoring stack
2. Automated compliance checks
3. Enhanced audit logging
4. Threat detection capabilities
5. Security metrics dashboard

## Incident Response

### Current Capabilities

- Manual investigation tools
- Basic logging analysis
- Infrastructure recovery
- Documentation procedures

### Planned Improvements

- Automated detection
- Real-time alerts
- Incident playbooks
- Response automation
