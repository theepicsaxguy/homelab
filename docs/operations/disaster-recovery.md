# Disaster Recovery Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for our GitOps-managed homelab infrastructure. All recovery
procedures follow our GitOps-only principles - changes must be made through Git and applied via ArgoCD.

## Recovery Scenarios

### 1. Complete Cluster Loss

#### Prerequisites

- Git repository access
- Talos machine configs
- DNS configuration
- Network access

#### Recovery Steps

1. Deploy new Talos nodes
2. Apply machine configurations
3. Bootstrap Kubernetes
4. Deploy ArgoCD
5. Restore applications

#### Estimated Recovery Time

- Core Infrastructure: 30 minutes
- Full Application Stack: 2 hours
- Data Restoration: Varies by volume

### 2. Node Failure

#### Single Node

1. Remove failed node
2. Deploy replacement
3. Join to cluster
4. Verify workload migration

#### Multiple Nodes

1. Assess cluster health
2. Replace failed nodes
3. Restore cluster state
4. Verify application health

### 3. Storage Failure

#### Volume Recovery

1. Stop affected workloads
2. Identify backup point
3. Restore from Restic
4. Verify data integrity
5. Resume services

#### Complete Storage Loss

1. Deploy new storage system
2. Restore from backups
3. Verify volume state
4. Resume applications

### 4. Network Failure

#### Temporary Disruption

1. Verify Cilium status
2. Check Gateway API
3. Test connectivity
4. Restore services

#### Complete Outage

1. Validate core networking
2. Restore Cilium
3. Verify DNS services
4. Check application connectivity

## Backup Components

### Current Backup Systems

#### Application Data

- System: Restic
- Location: S3 Storage
- Schedule: Daily
- Retention: 7 days

#### Configuration

- System: Git Repository
- Location: GitHub
- Backup: On every change
- History: Complete

#### Secrets

- System: Bitwarden
- Security: Encrypted
- Backup: Automated
- Access: Restricted

## Recovery Prerequisites

### Access Requirements

- Git repository credentials
- Infrastructure access tokens
- Backup system access
- DNS management access

### Documentation Requirements

- Machine configurations
- Network details
- DNS records
- Service credentials

## Testing Procedures

### Regular Testing

- Monthly recovery drills
- Backup restoration tests
- Configuration verification
- Documentation review

### Validation Steps

1. Core services check
2. Application health
3. Data integrity
4. Network connectivity

## Current Limitations

### Known Issues

1. No automated recovery
2. Manual backup verification
3. Basic health monitoring
4. Limited automation

### Planned Improvements

1. Automated recovery
2. Enhanced monitoring
3. Backup automation
4. Recovery testing

## Recovery Priorities

### Critical Services

1. Core Infrastructure

   - Kubernetes API
   - ArgoCD
   - Network (Cilium)

2. Essential Services

   - Authentication (Authelia)
   - DNS (CoreDNS)
   - Storage (Longhorn)

3. User Applications
   - Media services
   - Development tools
   - External integrations

## Environment Recovery

### Development

- Minimal data recovery
- Quick infrastructure restore
- Basic functionality check
- Development tools priority

### Staging

- Representative data
- Full infrastructure
- Integration testing
- Performance validation

### Production

- Complete data recovery
- Zero-data-loss target
- Full service restoration
- Performance verification

## Documentation Requirements

### During Recovery

- Track all actions
- Document timing
- Note any issues
- Record solutions

### Post-Recovery

- Update procedures
- Document lessons
- Improve processes
- Update testing

## Contact Information

### Primary Contacts

- Infrastructure Lead
- Security Team
- Network Team
- Storage Team

### Escalation Path

1. Infrastructure Team
2. Security Team
3. Management
4. External Support
